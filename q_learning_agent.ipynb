        "*Text Adventure Games* are games in which the player interacts with a rich world only through text. Text adventure games predate computers with graphics. However, in many ways they are more complex than conventional video games because they can involve complicated interactions (e.g., \"build a rope bridge\") that require a fair amount of imagination. Indeed, text adventure games are used as [research testbeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05398) for natural language processing agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "The canonical text adventure game is [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), in which the player discover an abandoned underworld realm full of treasure. You can find online playable versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "A text game is made up of individual locations--also called \"rooms\", though they need not be indoor enclosed spaces as the term might imply. The agent can move between rooms and interact with objects by typing in short commands like \"move north\" and \"take lamp\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, we will use a special package that implements text worlds for testing agents: [TextWorld-Express](https://github.com/cognitiveailab/TextWorldExpress). Textworld-Express simplifies text worlds in a few ways: it uses a reduced set of text commands, and rooms laid out in a grid.\n",
        "TextWorld-Express also implements a few different game objectives, such as cooking, and searching for coins.\n",
        "TextWorld-Express generates world configurations, so we will need to implement algorithms that are able to complete different game objectives in different world configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, our agents will play a custom game wherein the agent must locate a ghost that cannot be directly observed based on noises that can be perceived with some probabilistic uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "**We will be implementing and using Bayesian Networks for this part of Assignment 3.**\n",
        "\n",
        "You are prohibited from using any python package that does not come default with Python, except `textworld-express`, `graphviz`, and `pydot`, which are loaded as part of this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes:**\n",
        "- If you break execution of a cell running the game engine, you may put TextWorld-Express in an un-recoverable state. If this happens, you will need to reset your kernel/runtime.\n",
        "- In the Map Reader game, you **can** use the map information.\n",
        "- ***DO NOT REMOVE ANY COMMENTS THAT HAVE `# export` IN THEM. THE GRADING SCRIPT USES THESE COMMENTS TO EVALUATE YOUR FUNCTIONS. WE WILL NOT AUDIT SUBMISSIONS TO ADD THESE. IF THE AUTOGRADER FAILS TO RUN DUE TO YOUR MODIFICATION OF THESE COMMENTS, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE CREDIT.***\n"
