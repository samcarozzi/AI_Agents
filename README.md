# AI Projects üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of AI projects completed as part of my *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* course. Each project demonstrates the application of key AI techniques, including search algorithms, probabilistic reasoning, and reinforcement learning, within dynamic environments.

## üåü Overview

Throughout the course, I explored various AI methodologies to build systems that interact intelligently with their environments. Key concepts covered include:

- **Search Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A*, Uniformed and Informed Search
- **Markov Decision Processes**: For optimal decision-making in uncertain environments
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Handling uncertainty and noisy data in AI systems
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques like Q-learning in a reinforcement learning context

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **Search Algorithms in AI**
   - Implemented search algorithms such as DFS, BFS, A*, and Uniform Cost Search.
   - Applied these within a game-based context, calculating Manhattan distances and managing noisy distance data.

### 2. **Probabilistic Search Agents**
   - Developed agents capable of reasoning with uncertainty to perform effective searches.
   - Integrated probabilistic calculations to manage noisy data and optimize decision-making.

### 3. **Q-Learning Adventure Game**
   - Built a reinforcement learning agent to navigate a text-based adventure game using Q-learning.
   - Implemented reward structures and environment states to train the agent effectively.
